# Cripter

Cripter is a simple password manager that allows you to encrypt, store, decrypt, and delete passwords—all with a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Secure encryption using a master password (Vigenère cipher).
- No password storage: Both the original password and the master password are **never saved** on disk, making it impossible for hackers to retrieve them.
